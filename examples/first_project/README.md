# First Project

A simple project for beginners to get started with.

## Objectives

This project will show you how to:

- Search for an item
- Create a new page
- Query a database

## Create a demo page

Lastly we need a notion page to experiment with.
Duplicate [this page](https://www.notion.so/notion-sdk-py-540f8e2b79914654ba103c5d8a03e10e)
in your workspace.

After [creating an integration](https://www.notion.com/my-integrations),
[share](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization) the page with the
integration. To do so, visit the page in your Notion workspace, click the •••
menu at the top right of a page, scroll down to `Add connections`, and use the
search bar to find and select the integration from the dropdown list.

## Run the script

Make sure your have `notion-sdk-py` installed.

You may optionally install `python-dotenv`
if you want the script to load your `.env` file.

```shell
python script.py
```
