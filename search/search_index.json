The code is evolving rapidly; feel free to join the fun by opening an issue or PR. Installation pip install notion-client Usage Before getting started, create an integration and find the token. \u2192 Learn more about authorization . Import and initialize a client using an integration token or an OAuth access token . import os from notion_client import Client notion = Client ( auth = os . environ [ \"NOTION_TOKEN\" ]) In an asyncio environment, use the asynchronous client instead: from notion_client import AsyncClient notion = AsyncClient ( auth = os . environ [ \"NOTION_TOKEN\" ]) Make a request to any Notion API endpoint. See the complete list of endpoints in the API reference . from pprint import pprint list_users_response = notion . users . list () pprint ( list_users_response ) or with the asynchronous client: list_users_response = await notion . users . list () pprint ( list_users_response ) This would output something like: {'results': [{'avatar_url': 'https://secure.notion-static.com/e6a352a8-8381-44d0-a1dc-9ed80e62b53d.jpg', 'id': 'd40e767c-d7af-4b18-a86d-55c61f1e39a4', 'name': 'Avocado Lovelace', 'object': 'user', 'person': {'email': 'avo@example.org'}, 'type': 'person'}, ...]} All API endpoints are available in both the synchronous and asynchronous clients. Endpoint parameters are grouped into a single object.

The error contains properties from the response, and the most helpful is code .

ObjectNotFound : ... # For example: handle by asking the user to select a different database else : # Other error handling code logging . exception () Logging The client emits useful information to a logger. By default, it only emits warnings and errors. If you're debugging an application, and would like the client to log response bodies, set the log_level option to logging.DEBUG . notion = Client ( auth = os . environ [ \"NOTION_TOKEN\" ], log_level = logging . DEBUG , ) You may also set a custom logger to emit logs to a destination other than stdout . Have a look at Python's logging cookbook if you want to create your own logger. Client options Client and AsyncClient both support the following options on initialization. These options are all keys in the single constructor parameter. Option Default value Type Description auth None string Bearer token for authentication. If left undefined, the auth parameter should be set on each request. log_level logging.WARNING int Verbosity of logs the instance will produce. By default, logs are written to stdout . timeout_ms 60_000 int Number of milliseconds to wait before emitting a RequestTimeoutError base_url \"https://api.notion.com\" string The root URL for sending API requests. This can be changed to test with a mock server. logger Log to console logging.Logger A custom logger. Requirements This package supports the following minimum versions: Python >= 3.7 httpx >= 0.15.0 Earlier versions may still work, but we encourage people building new applications to upgrade to the current stable.
